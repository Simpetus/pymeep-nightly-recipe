These configuration files are copied from the pymeep-feedstock repo, where they
were generated by conda-smithy. Since Smithy knows a lot more about doing conda
builds than we do, then it makes sense to just use these files rather doing it
ourselves, and it's a lot less messy than using conda-smithy directly in this
project.

These files should be checked periodically and copied again from
pymeep-feedstock if there have been changes.
